api call in js
--------------

AJAX
 
 -XMLhttp
 -fetch
 -asynch await

 redirection In react
 --------------------

 react-router-dom
         - npm i react-router-dom


import {
    BrowserRouter as Router - all routing need components
    Routes                  - to set paths for each components
    Route                   - morethan one path
}

useParams - hook used to access params from component url


 REDUX
-------

coupling - many connection between parents nd child component

props drilling - in coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all 
                 other child will not work


- To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components
  independent

- for this react introduced a new technology -state management technology called REDUX


Redux process
-------------

- create a new js file to keep the state, all the components can access the js file


- components can access tha datas from the js file
  but they can't update datas in the js file












libraries to apply Redux
------------------------

1. REDUX
2. REACT REDUX
3. REACT-THUNK

      npm i redux react-redux-thunk


createStore() - method in REDUX used to create store in js file
              - 2 arguments
                  1. reducer
                  2. middleware (used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous)


applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() - method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file


thunk - method in REDUX-THUNK used to create middleware

(...) - spread operator


1. create store
2. apply the store in index.js      
- provide : is a tag used to pass  the store
